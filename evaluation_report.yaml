overall_score: 8.6
passed: true
notes:
  strengths: "Agent successfully implemented the feature to preserve all emails, phones, and links during record merging. Added comprehensive test coverage (481 additions vs ground truth's 162), including 3 new unit tests and multiple integration test cases. All three utility functions (emails, phones, links) were correctly modified. The implementation is functionally correct and handles deduplication properly."
  weaknesses: "Implementation approach differs from ground truth - uses explicit conditional checks instead of the more elegant 'collect all, then filter' approach. The agent's code is more verbose with extra conditions (checking recordId !== priorityRecordId) whereas ground truth has simpler logic flow. Ground truth's approach is cleaner and more maintainable."
  deviations:
    positive:
      - "Added significantly more test coverage than ground truth (481 lines vs 162 lines of additions)"
      - "Created 3 dedicated unit tests for the new behavior (preserve primary from non-priority records)"
      - "Added multiple integration test cases in both people and companies merge specs"
    neutral:
      - "Different implementation style - agent uses explicit conditional filtering while ground truth uses collect-all-then-filter approach"
      - "Both approaches achieve identical functional results with proper deduplication"
      - "Agent's approach is more verbose but arguably more explicit about intent"
    negative:
      - "Less elegant code structure compared to ground truth's simpler 'collect everything upfront' approach"
      - "Ground truth uses fewer conditional branches making code easier to understand and maintain"
      - "Agent's implementation requires checking both recordId and value equality, adding complexity"
