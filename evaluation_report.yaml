overall_score: 7.1
passed: true
notes:
  strengths: "The agent correctly identified and fixed both core issues: (1) invalid UUID format in example values, and (2) objects/arrays showing as '[Object object]' in CSV exports. The solution is functional and addresses the reported bug. The commit message is well-written and descriptive."
  weaknesses: "The agent's approach differs from the ground truth in two significant ways: (1) UUID values don't match the ground truth format (uses made-up UUIDs vs. ground truth's UUID v4 format with specific version/variant bits), and (2) the JSON.stringify fix was applied at a different location in the code (in buildTableWithFakeRecords for composite fields only, rather than in formatToCsvContent for all field types). The ground truth's approach is more comprehensive as it handles all non-string values uniformly, while the agent's approach only handles composite field values. No tests were added."
  deviations:
    neutral:
      - "Different UUID format: agent used realistic-looking UUIDs (e.g., '20202020-1c25-4d02-bf25-6aeccf7ea419') while ground truth used UUID v4 format with correct version/variant bits (e.g., '00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000000'). Both are valid UUIDs, but ground truth's format is more technically correct for showing UUID structure."
    negative:
      - "Applied JSON.stringify fix at different location: agent modified buildTableWithFakeRecords to only handle composite fields (lines 75-81), while ground truth modified formatToCsvContent to handle ALL field types uniformly (lines 124-129). Ground truth's approach is more robust and comprehensive."
      - "Did not update the type signature of formatToCsvContent: ground truth changed parameter type from 'string[][]' to '(string | JSON | string[])[][]', but agent left it as 'string[][]', which is now technically incorrect since buildTableWithFakeRecords can now push non-string values."
      - "Did not simplify the array spread: ground truth removed unnecessary array spread in formatToCsvContent ('[...escapedRows.map...]' to 'escapedRows.map...'), but agent left the verbose version."
      - "No tests were added to verify the fix works correctly, though ground truth PR also did not include tests."
