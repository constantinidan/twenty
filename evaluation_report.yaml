issue: "Preserve all emails, phones, and links when merging records"
overall_score: 4.3
passed: false
notes:
  strengths: |
    - Implementation preserves all emails, phones, and links from non-priority records
    - Correctly handles deduplication using Set and uniqBy
    - Integration tests have been updated with correct expectations
    - Code structure is reasonable and follows existing patterns
    - Properly checks for record field values before adding
  weaknesses: |
    - **CRITICAL**: Implementation uses conditional logic to exclude priority record's primary values, but ground truth collects ALL primary values from ALL records then filters them
    - **CRITICAL**: Variable names not renamed (allAdditionalEmails/allPhones/allSecondaryLinks instead of allEmails/allPhones/allLinks)
    - **CRITICAL**: Missing filter step to remove primaryEmail/primaryPhoneNumber/primaryLinkUrl from the collected values
    - **CRITICAL**: Ground truth approach is more consistent: collect all, then deduplicate and filter. Current approach mixes collection logic with conditional skipping
    - The approach difference may cause issues with complex merge scenarios where the same primary value appears multiple times
    - Unit tests in merge-field-values.util.spec.ts NOT updated to match ground truth expectations (should expect primary email to be included in additionalEmails)
  deviations:
    negative:
      - "Variable naming: Using 'allAdditionalEmails' instead of 'allEmails' makes the code less clear about collecting all values"
      - "Collection logic: Ground truth collects ALL primary values from ALL records. Current implementation conditionally skips priority record's primary value"
      - "Filtering: Ground truth filters out primaryEmail AFTER deduplication. Current implementation prevents adding it in the first place"
      - "Unit tests: merge-field-values.util.spec.ts test expects only 'extra1@example.com', 'extra2@example.com' but should expect 'first@example.com', 'extra1@example.com', 'extra2@example.com' (missing the primary email from non-priority record)"
      - "Unit tests: Missing test cases for PHONES and LINKS field types in merge-field-values.util.spec.ts"
scores:
  correctness: 4
