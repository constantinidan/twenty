ground_truth: https://github.com/twentyhq/twenty/pull/14286
issue: https://github.com/twentyhq/twenty/issues/14278
overall_score: 8.9
passed: true
notes:
  strengths: "The agent successfully fixed the double-click issue by disabling the submit button during form submission. The implementation is clean, uses React best practices, and correctly addresses the root cause. The code quality is excellent with proper TypeScript typing. The commit message is well-written and descriptive."
  weaknesses: "No tests were added. The ground truth also doesn't include tests, but given this is a UI interaction bug, a test would have been valuable to prevent regression. The component file itself has no existing test coverage."
  deviations:
    positive:
      - "Used react-hook-form's built-in isSubmitting state instead of manual useState, which is cleaner and more idiomatic for form handling"
      - "Avoids the need for try-finally blocks to manage loading state, reducing code complexity"
      - "Leverages existing form state rather than adding new state management"
    neutral:
      - "Different implementation approach but achieves the same functional outcome"
      - "Ground truth uses useState with try-finally pattern, while agent uses isSubmitting from form state"
    negative:
      - "Neither implementation includes tests, though this is a simple UI fix where tests might be considered optional"
