issue: https://github.com/twentyhq/twenty/issues/14278
overall_score: 9.2
passed: true
notes:
  strengths: "The coding agent's solution is actually superior to the ground truth. It leverages React Hook Form's built-in `form.formState.isSubmitting` state instead of manually managing state with useState, which is more idiomatic and eliminates the risk of state management bugs. The solution also includes a visual loading indicator (Loader icon) that provides better UX feedback. The implementation follows the exact same pattern used in SignInUpWithCredentials.tsx (line 110, 141-142), maintaining consistency across the codebase. The fix correctly solves the double-click issue by disabling the button during submission."
  weaknesses: "No tests were added, but this is acceptable given the trivial scope of the change (10 lines, simple UI fix). The component doesn't have existing tests, and adding tests for this simple state-based UI behavior would be disproportionate to the change complexity."
  deviations:
    positive:
      - "Used React Hook Form's built-in isSubmitting state instead of manual useState, which is more reliable and idiomatic"
      - "Added visual loading indicator (Loader icon) for better user feedback during submission"
      - "Follows existing codebase pattern from SignInUpWithCredentials.tsx, maintaining consistency"
      - "Eliminates potential state management bugs from manual try/finally cleanup"
    neutral:
      - "Different implementation approach but achieves the same functional outcome"
    negative:
      - "None - the implementation is actually an improvement over ground truth"
