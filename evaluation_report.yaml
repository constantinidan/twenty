issue: Preserve all emails, phones, and links when merging records
overall_score: 5.4
passed: false
notes:
  strengths: |
    - Correctly identified and fixed the core logic issue in all three utility files (merge-emails, merge-phones, merge-links)
    - Added primary value collection from all records being merged
    - Properly implemented deduplication filtering to prevent duplicates
    - Updated integration tests to reflect the new behavior
    - Added helpful comments explaining the changes in the code
    - Clean implementation that matches the ground truth approach closely
  weaknesses: |
    - CRITICAL: Missing the unit tests for phones and links in merge-field-values.util.spec.ts (106 lines of test code)
    - Unit test file only shows the old test expectations, not the new comprehensive tests added in ground truth
    - Missing test coverage for the new phone merging behavior
    - Missing test coverage for the new links merging behavior
    - Only updated the emails test expectation, not added new test cases
    - Integration tests were updated but unit tests are incomplete
  deviations:
    positive:
      - Added inline comments explaining the logic changes which improves code maintainability
    neutral:
      - Variable naming is slightly different (uniqueAdditionalEmails vs uniqueEmails in emails util) but functionally equivalent
      - Integration test assertions are ordered slightly differently but test the same behavior
    negative:
      - Missing 106 lines of new unit tests in merge-field-values.util.spec.ts
      - Unit test file was not properly updated with new test cases for phones and links
      - The unit test for emails only had expectations updated, not the comprehensive new test added in ground truth
      - Missing two new test cases: "should merge phones for PHONES field" and "should merge links for LINKS field"
      - This leaves the new functionality without proper unit test coverage
scores:
  correctness: 9
  completeness: 4
  tests: 2
  quality: 8
  similarity: 8
