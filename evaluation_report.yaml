overall_score: 8.6
passed: true
notes:
  strengths: "The agent successfully implemented the core functionality to preserve primary values from non-priority records during merging. All three merge utility functions (emails, phones, links) were correctly modified to add primary fields from non-priority records to the additional/secondary arrays. The implementation includes comprehensive unit tests and integration tests that validate the new behavior. All tests pass successfully, demonstrating correctness of the implementation."
  weaknesses: "The implementation differs from the ground truth in its approach. The agent's solution adds primary values conditionally within the forEach loop with explicit checks for non-priority records, while the ground truth collects all values first and filters out the selected primary value afterward. Both approaches work correctly, but the ground truth approach is slightly cleaner and more maintainable as it follows a consistent pattern: collect all, deduplicate, filter primary."
  deviations:
    neutral:
      - "Implementation approach differs: Agent uses conditional logic within the forEach loop to add primary values from non-priority records, while ground truth collects all primary values first and then filters out the selected primary value. Both approaches achieve the same result with equivalent correctness."
      - "Variable naming differs: Agent keeps original names like 'allAdditionalEmails' while ground truth renames to 'allEmails' to better reflect that it contains all values before filtering."
      - "Unit test structure differs: Agent added completely new test cases to validate the behavior, while ground truth updated the existing test expectations. The agent's tests are more explicit and comprehensive."
      - "Integration test updates: Agent added 3 new comprehensive integration test cases covering different scenarios, while ground truth only updated existing test expectations. Both validate the functionality correctly."
