overall_score: 8.2
passed: true
notes:
  strengths: |
    - Correctly identifies and fixes the core issue: primary values from non-priority records are now preserved
    - Implementation works correctly across all three field types (emails, phones, links)
    - Code follows the same logical approach as ground truth (collect primary values first, then additional values)
    - Updated integration tests correctly to reflect new expected behavior
    - Added deduplication logic to prevent the selected primary from appearing in additional values
    - Clean code structure with helpful comments
    - Comprehensive commit message explaining the changes

  weaknesses: |
    - Missing two comprehensive unit tests that were present in ground truth:
      * No unit test for PHONES field merge (ground truth has 50-line test)
      * No unit test for LINKS field merge (ground truth has 45-line test)
    - Only updated the existing EMAILS test but did not add new test cases for phones and links
    - Integration tests for companies were not updated (ground truth updated companies-merge-many.integration-spec.ts with 11 changes)
    - The implementation approach differs slightly from ground truth in variable naming and flow

  deviations:
    positive:
      - Implementation correctly handles deduplication to prevent primary value from appearing in additional values
      - Comments are helpful and explain the two-step collection process
    neutral:
      - Uses separate forEach loops instead of ground truth's approach of collecting all items first then filtering
      - Variable naming differs (allAdditionalEmails vs allEmails in ground truth)
      - Ground truth renames variables more consistently (allEmails, allPhones, allLinks) while working branch keeps old names
    negative:
      - Missing comprehensive unit tests for phones and links merge operations (106 lines of tests in ground truth)
      - Missing integration test updates for companies (11 lines in ground truth)
      - Test coverage is significantly less complete (only 1 test file vs 3 test files in ground truth)

scores:
  correctness: 9
  completeness: 7
  tests: 6
  quality: 8
  similarity: 8
