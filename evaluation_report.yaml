ground_truth: https://github.com/twentyhq/twenty/pull/14286
issue: https://github.com/twentyhq/twenty/issues/14278
overall_score: 7.9
passed: true
notes:
  strengths: "The agent correctly identified the root cause (double-click causing duplicate requests) and implemented a working solution using loading state to disable the submit button. The core fix is functionally correct and prevents the double-click issue. The code follows React best practices by using useState and properly managing async state."
  weaknesses: "No tests were added to verify the fix, which is a significant gap in completeness. The ground truth PR also doesn't include tests, but ideally both should have had tests for such a user-facing bug fix."
  deviations:
    positive:
      - "Added early return guard (if isLoading return) in submitOTP to provide an additional layer of protection against race conditions"
      - "Added loading check in handleBack function to prevent navigation while request is in progress, improving UX consistency"
      - "Reset isLoading in catch block instead of finally block, allowing successful login flow to proceed without resetting state (more elegant handling)"
      - "Moved useState import to top of imports following better organization"
    neutral:
      - "Used 'useState(false)' without type annotation vs ground truth 'useState<boolean>(false)' - both are correct, agent's approach is more concise and TypeScript infers the type correctly"
      - "Positioned isLoading state declaration after other hooks vs ground truth placed it before - both are valid ordering choices"
    negative:
      - "More complex state management with manual reset in catch block vs simpler finally block approach in ground truth - ground truth is cleaner and more standard for async error handling"
