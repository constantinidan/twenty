notes:
  strengths: "The agent's solution correctly fixes the double-click issue by disabling the submit button during form submission. The implementation is actually superior to the ground truth - it uses react-hook-form's built-in isSubmitting state instead of manually managing loading state with useState, which is more idiomatic and eliminates potential edge cases. Additionally, it includes a visual loading indicator (Loader component) that provides better UX feedback to users. The commit message is clear and descriptive, explaining both the problem and the solution."
  weaknesses: "No tests were added for this functionality. However, given that this is a simple UI fix (< 10 lines of actual logic change) and there are no existing tests for this component in the codebase, this is acceptable. The component is primarily presentational with the fix being a straightforward prop addition."
  deviations:
    positive:
      - "Uses react-hook-form's built-in form.formState.isSubmitting instead of manual useState hook - more idiomatic and eliminates need for manual state management in try/finally blocks"
      - "Adds a Loader component as visual feedback during submission - better UX than just disabling the button"
      - "Cleaner implementation with less code (no need for useState, setIsLoading calls, or try/finally for state management)"
      - "More robust - isSubmitting automatically handles all async submission states including errors and edge cases"
