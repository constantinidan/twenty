issue: When merging records in CRM, primary values (emails, phones, links) from non-priority records were being lost. The fix preserves all primary values by adding them to secondary/additional arrays.
overall_score: 7.9
passed: true
notes:
  strengths: "The agent correctly identified the core issue and implemented a working solution across all three field types (emails, phones, links). The logic correctly preserves primary values from non-priority records and adds proper deduplication. Comprehensive unit tests were added including edge cases for deduplication and multiple record merging. The people integration tests were properly updated. Code quality is clean with helpful comments explaining the logic."
  weaknesses: "Missing the companies-merge-many.integration-spec.ts file update - this is a significant completeness gap as the ground truth updated both people AND companies integration tests to verify the fix works across different entity types. The variable naming differs slightly from ground truth (kept 'allAdditionalEmails' instead of renaming to 'allEmails'), making the code slightly less semantic. The implementation approach differs by filtering earlier rather than collecting all items first then filtering, which is less clean but functionally equivalent."
  deviations:
    neutral:
      - "Variable naming: Kept original names like 'allAdditionalEmails' instead of renaming to 'allEmails' as ground truth did - less semantic but functionally equivalent"
      - "Implementation approach: Filters during collection (checking '!== primaryEmail' inline) rather than collecting all then filtering at end - different style but same result"
      - "Deduplication placement: Agent filters duplicates during collection in multiple places, ground truth collected all then deduplicated once at the end"
    negative:
      - "Missing companies-merge-many.integration-spec.ts updates - ground truth updated this file to verify links merge correctly for companies, but agent only updated people tests"
      - "The unit tests use different test data structure - agent's phones test uses different phone numbers than ground truth, making comparison harder"
