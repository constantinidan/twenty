ground_truth: https://github.com/twentyhq/twenty/pull/14286
issue: https://github.com/twentyhq/twenty/issues/14278
overall_score: 8.3
passed: true
notes:
  strengths: |
    - Successfully fixes the double-click issue by preventing multiple submissions
    - Uses react-hook-form's built-in formState.isSubmitting instead of manual state
    - More robust approach than ground truth (leverages form library features)
    - Disables both the submit button AND the OTP input field (extra safety)
    - Adds visual feedback with Loader icon on the submit button
    - Code is clean and follows React best practices
    - Properly handles the disabled state with CSS opacity styling
  weaknesses: |
    - Missing tests (ground truth also has no tests, but this is still a weakness)
    - Slightly more complex than ground truth due to Loader icon addition
    - No validation that formState.isSubmitting properly resets on error
  deviations:
    positive:
      - "Uses formState.isSubmitting from react-hook-form instead of manual useState, which is more idiomatic and reliable"
      - "Disables the OTP input field in addition to the submit button, providing double protection against race conditions"
      - "Adds visual feedback with Loader icon, improving user experience"
      - "Eliminates try/finally block since form.handleSubmit automatically manages isSubmitting state"
    neutral:
      - "Different state management approach (formState vs useState) but both are valid"
      - "Visual styling with opacity:0.3 on disabled OTP input vs no visual change in ground truth"
    negative:
      - "Adds import for Loader component which increases bundle size slightly (minimal impact)"
