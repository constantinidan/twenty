overall_score: 5.6
passed: false
notes:
  strengths: "The agent correctly identified the need to add a banner for truncated chart data, updated the GRAPH_MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_GROUPS constant from 50 to 200, added the isTruncated flag throughout the data transformation pipeline, and successfully integrated a banner UI component with appropriate messaging."
  weaknesses: "Major architectural deviation: The agent used a simpler but problematic approach by directly calling useGraphBarChartWidgetData hook in ChartSettings with a workaround for non-bar charts (passing dummy config). This violates React best practices and creates tight coupling. The agent used the existing Info component instead of creating the new SidePanelInformationBanner component. Missing critical state management infrastructure: no component instance context, no Recoil component state, no effect component for state synchronization. The banner won't properly clear when switching between widgets or graph types. No handling of graph type changes to reset the banner state. Missing Storybook stories for the new component."
  deviations:
    negative:
      - "Used existing Info component instead of creating new SidePanelInformationBanner component as ground truth did"
      - "Missing entire state management architecture with GraphWidgetComponentInstanceContext and hasWidgetTooManyGroupsComponentState"
      - "Missing GraphWidgetBarChartHasTooManyGroupsEffect component for proper state synchronization"
      - "Direct hook call in ChartSettings with dummy config workaround instead of proper component-scoped state management"
      - "No context provider wrapping in GraphWidgetRenderer and CommandMenuPageLayoutGraphTypeSelect"
      - "Banner state won't reset when switching graph types from bar charts to other chart types"
      - "Missing Storybook stories for the new banner component"
      - "Tight coupling between ChartSettings and bar chart data hook creates architectural issues"
