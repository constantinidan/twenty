overall_score: 6.7
passed: false
notes:
  strengths: |
    - Correctly identified and fixed the UUID issue with more realistic-looking UUID examples (though different format than ground truth)
    - Properly addressed the core issue of serializing composite field objects and arrays to JSON strings
    - Added comprehensive handling for ARRAY and RAW_JSON field types with dedicated case branches
    - Added serialization logic for composite field sub-objects (additionalEmails, additionalPhones, secondaryLinks)
    - Commit message is descriptive and explains the changes made
    - Same two files modified as in ground truth
  weaknesses: |
    - Did NOT update the formatToCsvContent function type signature and implementation as the ground truth did
    - The ground truth changed formatToCsvContent to handle (string | JSON | string[][])[][] and stringify non-string values, but the agent left this function unchanged
    - This means if any non-string values slip through the buildTableWithFakeRecords function, they would still cause "[Object object]" issues
    - The agent's UUID values use a different format (20202020-xxxx pattern) versus ground truth's more standard format (00000000-0000-4000-8000-xxxx)
    - Ground truth simplified csvContent generation by removing unnecessary spread operator, agent did not make this cleanup
    - No tests added (though for this small fix scope, this is acceptable)
  deviations:
    neutral:
      - Different UUID example format used (20202020-based vs 00000000-0000-4000-8000-based), both are valid UUIDs but ground truth follows UUID v4 structure more closely
      - More extensive changes to buildTableWithFakeRecords with dedicated ARRAY/RAW_JSON case block (17 lines) versus ground truth's simpler approach
    negative:
      - Missing the critical formatToCsvContent type signature and implementation update that provides a safety net for any non-string values
      - This is a defensive programming measure in the ground truth that ensures robustness
      - Did not include the code cleanup removing unnecessary spread operator in csvContent generation
