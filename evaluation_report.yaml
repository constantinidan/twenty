notes:
  strengths: |
    The agent successfully implemented a working solution that prevents double-click submissions
    on the 2FA verification form. The approach using React Hook Form's built-in isSubmitting state
    is cleaner and more elegant than the ground truth's manual useState implementation. The solution
    is functionally correct, properly disables the button during submission, and follows React best
    practices by leveraging existing form state rather than duplicating it. The commit message is
    clear and descriptive.
  weaknesses: |
    The implementation lacks tests, which would be valuable for ensuring the double-click prevention
    behavior works correctly. No unit tests or integration tests were added to verify that the button
    is properly disabled during submission. Additionally, no visual testing (Storybook stories) was
    added to demonstrate the loading state behavior.
  deviations:
    positive:
      - "Uses React Hook Form's built-in isSubmitting state instead of manual useState, eliminating the need to import useState and manually manage loading state"
      - "Cleaner implementation with fewer lines of code (2 additions vs 13 additions) while achieving the same functional outcome"
      - "Avoids manual state management in finally block, letting React Hook Form handle the lifecycle automatically"
      - "No linting issues in the final code, properly formatted from the start"
    neutral:
      - "Different approach (form state vs manual state) but achieves identical user-facing behavior"
    negative:
      - "No tests added, whereas comprehensive testing would strengthen confidence in the fix"
