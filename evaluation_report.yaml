issue: Preserve all emails, phones, and links when merging records
overall_score: 10.0
passed: true
notes:
  strengths: "The implementation is identical to the ground truth PR. All three merge utility functions (emails, phones, links) were correctly modified to collect ALL values (both primary and additional) from all records being merged, then filter out the selected primary value to avoid duplication. The logic correctly handles edge cases like filtering out the primary value from the additional list. Comprehensive tests were added covering all three field types with proper deduplication scenarios. Integration tests were updated to reflect the new expected behavior. The code is clean, well-structured, and maintains consistency across all three similar functions."
  weaknesses: "None identified. The implementation matches the ground truth exactly in both approach and execution."
  deviations:
    neutral:
      - "Implementation is identical to ground truth - no deviations detected"
