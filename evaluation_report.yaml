ground_truth: https://github.com/twentyhq/twenty/pull/14286
issue: https://github.com/twentyhq/twenty/issues/14278
overall_score: 8.4
passed: true
notes:
  strengths: |
    - Correctly fixes the double-click issue by disabling the button during submission
    - Uses react-hook-form's built-in form state (form.formState.isSubmitting) instead of managing separate state
    - Cleaner implementation with fewer imports and less boilerplate code
    - No unnecessary useState hook - leverages existing form library patterns
    - Code is more maintainable and idiomatic for react-hook-form usage
    - Achieves the same functional result as the ground truth PR
  weaknesses: |
    - No unit tests added to verify the behavior (consistent with ground truth which also had no tests)
    - Minimal approach lacks explicit state management, though this is actually a strength in this context
  deviations:
    positive:
      - Uses form.formState.isSubmitting instead of manually managing isLoading state with useState
      - More idiomatic react-hook-form pattern that reduces unnecessary state management
      - Cleaner code with fewer lines and imports
      - Better separation of concerns - relies on form library for form submission state tracking
    neutral:
      - Different implementation approach (built-in form state vs manual state), but produces identical user-facing behavior
scores:
  correctness: 10
  completeness: 9
  tests: 3
  quality: 9
  similarity: 8
