passed: true
notes:
  strengths: "The implementation correctly fixes the double-click issue by preventing duplicate submissions. The solution adds loading state management and disables the submit button during requests. Additionally, the agent implementation goes beyond the ground truth by: (1) adding an early return guard (`if (isLoading) return`) to prevent race conditions if the handler is somehow invoked twice, (2) disabling the OTP input field during submission for better UX consistency, and (3) moving `setIsLoading(true)` inside the try block for better error handling semantics."
  weaknesses: "No tests were added for this change. While the ground truth PR also lacks tests, adding test coverage would strengthen confidence in the fix. The change is relatively simple (< 20 lines) so lack of tests is not critical but would be beneficial for preventing regressions."
  deviations:
    positive:
      - "Added early return guard (`if (isLoading) return`) at the start of submitOTP to prevent race conditions if the function is invoked multiple times before state updates"
      - "Disabled the OTP input field during submission (line 238: `disabled={isLoading}`), providing better UX consistency beyond just disabling the button"
      - "Moved `setIsLoading(true)` inside the try block after the early return check, which is more robust error handling"
      - "Used implicit boolean type (`useState(false)`) instead of explicit type annotation (`useState<boolean>(false)`), following React best practices"
    neutral:
      - "TypeScript type annotation style: Ground truth uses explicit `useState<boolean>(false)`, agent uses implicit `useState(false)`. Both are correct, implicit is more idiomatic in React."
      - "Placement of useState hook: Both implementations place it correctly at the component start, just with slightly different formatting"
    negative:
      - "No significant negative deviations - the implementation is actually more robust than the ground truth"
