issue: https://github.com/twentyhq/twenty/issues/14278
overall_score: 9.2
passed: true
notes:
  strengths:
    - "Correctly identifies and uses React Hook Form's built-in isSubmitting state instead of adding unnecessary manual state management"
    - "Implementation is clean and minimal - only 8 lines of code changes as intended"
    - "Proper use of form.formState.isSubmitting which automatically handles loading state during form submission"
    - "Correctly disables the MainButton during submission to prevent double-click issues"
    - "Matches the ground truth implementation exactly in the final form"
    - "Commit message is clear and descriptive, following project conventions"
    - "The solution is elegant and leverages existing form infrastructure rather than over-engineering"

  weaknesses:
    - "No test file created to verify the disabled state behavior during submission (ground truth also lacks this)"
    - "No explicit user interaction testing documented, though the fix is straightforward and testable manually"

  deviations:
    positive:
      - "Commit message is slightly more detailed than ground truth, providing better context about why isSubmitting is used"

    neutral: []

    negative: []
