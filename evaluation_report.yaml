issue: Preserve all emails, phones, and links when merging records
overall_score: 0.0
passed: false
notes:
  strengths: "None - no implementation was attempted"
  weaknesses: "The coding agent made no changes whatsoever. All three core utility files (merge-emails-field-values.util.ts, merge-phones-field-values.util.ts, merge-links-field-values.util.ts) remain in their original state without the required modifications. No unit tests were added or updated. No integration tests were modified. The branch has a clean working tree with no commits made by the agent."
  deviations:
    negative:
      - "Complete failure to implement any aspect of the PR - no code changes made"
      - "Did not add logic to collect all primary values (emails, phones, links) from merged records"
      - "Did not filter duplicates between primary and collected values"
      - "Did not add unit tests for phones merging behavior"
      - "Did not add unit tests for links merging behavior"
      - "Did not update existing email merge unit test to expect primary email in additionals"
      - "Did not update integration tests for companies to expect primary links in secondary lists"
      - "Did not update integration tests for people to expect primary emails and phones in additional lists"
      - "The issue requires preserving all data when merging (primary emails/phones/links from all records should become additionals), but agent did nothing"
