issue: Preserve all emails, phones, and links when merging records
overall_score: 7.1
passed: true
notes:
  strengths: |
    - Correctly identifies and solves the core problem: primary values from non-priority records were being lost during merge
    - Implements the fix in all three affected utility files (emails, phones, links)
    - Updates integration tests to verify the new behavior
    - Maintains deduplication logic correctly
    - Code is clean and follows the existing patterns
    - Handles edge cases (checks if value is different from primaryEmail/Phone/Link before adding)
  weaknesses: |
    - Missing unit tests: The ground truth PR adds comprehensive unit tests in merge-field-values.util.spec.ts (106 new lines of unit tests covering phones and links merging)
    - Integration test updates are incomplete: Missing some test assertions that exist in ground truth (e.g., first-priority link in companies merge test)
    - Different implementation approach: Uses a conditional check to exclude priority record (record.recordId !== priorityRecordId) instead of collecting ALL values and filtering at the end
  deviations:
    neutral:
      - "Implementation uses conditional filtering approach (if record.recordId !== priorityRecordId) vs ground truth's collect-all-then-filter approach"
      - "Both approaches achieve the same functional outcome with proper deduplication"
      - "Agent's approach may be slightly more efficient (fewer operations) but ground truth is more uniform/consistent in handling all records the same way"
    negative:
      - "Missing unit tests for phones and links fields in merge-field-values.util.spec.ts - ground truth adds 106 lines of unit tests"
      - "Integration test updates are incomplete - missing assertion for 'first-priority' link URL in one test case"
      - "Unit test for emails field was not updated to reflect new behavior (should include 'first@example.com' in additionalEmails)"
scores:
  correctness: 9
