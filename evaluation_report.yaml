notes:
  strengths: "Both implementations successfully fix the core issues: (1) Invalid UUIDs replaced with valid v4 format UUIDs, and (2) Array/object serialization fixed to prevent '[Object object]' output. The agent's approach is more comprehensive with a dedicated serializeValueForCSV helper function that handles all value types systematically at the data preparation stage."
  weaknesses: "The agent's UUID values (20202020-0001-4000-8000-000000000001) differ from ground truth (00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000000), though both are valid v4 UUIDs. The agent's approach adds more code complexity with the helper function, while ground truth achieves the same result with a more minimal change in formatToCsvContent. No tests were added by either implementation, which is acceptable given the straightforward nature of the fix."
  deviations:
    positive:
      - "More systematic approach with serializeValueForCSV helper that centralizes value serialization logic"
      - "Handles value serialization earlier in the pipeline (during buildTableWithFakeRecords) rather than later in formatToCsvContent"
      - "Explicitly handles null/undefined cases and different data types with clear logic"
      - "Better separation of concerns - serialization is distinct from CSV formatting"
    neutral:
      - "Different UUID format chosen (20202020-0001-4000-8000-*) vs ground truth (00000000-0000-4000-8000-*), both valid v4 UUIDs"
      - "Cleaner code in formatToCsvContent without spread operator [...escapedRows.map()] vs ground truth"
    negative:
      - "More code added (24 lines) vs ground truth (minimal change in formatToCsvContent)"
      - "Changes formatToCsvContent type signature but agent's buildTableWithFakeRecords already returns string[][], making the type change unnecessary"
      - "Ground truth's approach is more surgical - fixes issue exactly where type coercion is needed"
