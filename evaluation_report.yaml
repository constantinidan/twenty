issue: Preserve all emails, phones, and links when merging records
overall_score: 8.2
passed: true
notes:
  strengths: |
    - Correctly identifies and fixes the core issue: primary values from non-priority records were being lost during merge operations
    - Implements the fix across all three affected utilities (emails, phones, links)
    - Adds comprehensive unit tests for the new behavior with dedicated test cases for each field type
    - Updates integration tests to reflect the correct expected behavior
    - Code is clean, well-commented, and follows existing patterns
    - Proper deduplication logic to avoid duplicate entries
    - Good commit message explaining the issue and solution
  weaknesses: |
    - Implementation approach differs slightly from ground truth - uses conditional check during collection instead of filter-at-end approach
    - Missing the comprehensive unit tests from ground truth (phones and links merging tests)
    - Integration test for "should respect priority in merge" case is incomplete - missing the assertion for 'first@example.com' in additionalEmails
    - Integration test for priority case in companies is incomplete - missing assertion for 'https://linkedin.com/company/first-priority' in secondaryLinks
    - Variable naming is less clean (keeps old names like allAdditionalEmails vs renaming to allEmails)
  deviations:
    neutral:
      - "Agent uses conditional check (record.value.primaryEmail !== primaryEmail) during collection, while ground truth collects all emails first then filters duplicates at the end - both approaches work but ground truth is slightly cleaner"
      - "Agent adds inline comments explaining the logic, which is helpful but not present in ground truth"
    negative:
      - "Missing comprehensive unit tests: ground truth adds 'should merge phones for PHONES field' and 'should merge links for LINKS field' tests with full examples, agent only adds simple preservation tests"
      - "Integration tests incomplete: agent fails to update assertions in people-merge-many.integration-spec.ts for the priority case (missing 'first@example.com' expectation on line 218)"
      - "Integration tests incomplete: agent fails to update assertions in companies-merge-many.integration-spec.ts for the priority case (missing first-priority link expectation)"
      - "Variable naming is inconsistent: agent keeps 'allAdditionalEmails' but should rename to 'allEmails' for clarity (as done in ground truth)"
scores:
  correctness: 9
  completeness: 7
