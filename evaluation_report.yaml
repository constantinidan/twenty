overall_score: 4.2
passed: false  # false if < 7
notes:
  strengths: |
    - Correctly identified the core problem: .env file loading was causing authentication confusion
    - Removed the loadEnvironmentVariables() method that was loading .env files
    - Removed the dotenv import from ConfigService
    - Updated config.command.ts to clarify that environment variables override config
    - Added helpful UI text showing config file location
    - Made a clean, focused commit with good documentation
  weaknesses: |
    - CRITICAL MISS: Did not delete the .env.e2e file which was a key part of the ground truth solution
    - CRITICAL MISS: Did not create the test setup infrastructure (setupTest.ts, testConfig.ts) to replace .env-based testing
    - CRITICAL MISS: Did not update jest.e2e.config.ts to add setupFilesAfterEnv
    - CRITICAL MISS: Did not update package.json version from 0.1.3 to 0.2.0 (breaking change)
    - INCOMPLETE: Kept the getEnvironmentConfig() method and still allows env variables to override, which was supposed to be removed
    - The solution is only about 30% complete - it removed .env loading but didn't replace the test infrastructure or clean up fully
  deviations:
    positive:
      - Added user-facing improvements to config.command.ts with better messaging about config file location and environment variable override behavior
    neutral:
      - Added comments to config display in ConfigCommand which weren't in ground truth but are helpful
    negative:
      - Did not delete .env.e2e file (ground truth removed it completely)
      - Did not create test setup files (setupTest.ts, testConfig.ts constants)
      - Did not update jest.e2e.config.ts to use setupFilesAfterEnv
      - Did not bump package version to 0.2.0 (breaking change indicator)
      - Did not fully remove environment variable override logic (kept getEnvironmentConfig method)
      - Did not remove comments in config.service.ts that ground truth removed
      - Did not make configPath readonly as ground truth did
scores:
  correctness: 4  # Partially fixes issue but incomplete - env loading removed but test infrastructure not updated
  completeness: 3  # Missing ~70% of changes: .env.e2e deletion, test setup files, jest config, version bump, full env cleanup
  tests: 2  # Major regression - removed .env.e2e but didn't create replacement test infrastructure
  quality: 6  # Code changes made are clean but incomplete solution
  similarity: 3  # Took similar approach but missed majority of implementation details
