overall_score: 1.1
passed: false
notes:
  strengths: "The agent demonstrated understanding of the metrics system architecture and correctly implemented the technical pattern (adding MetricsKeys enum entries, injecting MetricsService, importing MetricsModule, and calling incrementCounter). The code quality is clean and follows NestJS conventions."
  weaknesses: "The agent completely misunderstood the requirements and implemented the WRONG metrics in the WRONG locations. Instead of tracking 'cron job deleted workspaces' in cleaner.workspace-service.ts, it tracked workspace deletions in workspace.service.ts. Instead of tracking 'webhook calls completed' in call-webhook.job.ts, it tracked webhook creation in webhook.service.ts. These are fundamentally different events that would provide completely different observability data. The implementation does not address the actual issue requirements at all."
  deviations:
    negative:
      - "Implemented WorkspaceHardDeleted metric in workspace.service.ts instead of CronJobDeletedWorkspace in cleaner.workspace-service.ts - tracks general workspace deletions rather than specifically cron job deletions"
      - "Implemented WebhookCreated metric in webhook.service.ts instead of JobWebhookCallCompleted in call-webhook.job.ts - tracks webhook creation events rather than webhook execution/call events"
      - "Did not modify any of the 5 files that the ground truth PR modified (call-webhook.job.ts, webhook-job.module.ts, cleaner.workspace-service.ts, workspace-cleaner.module.ts, metrics-keys.type.ts)"
      - "Used different metric key names (WorkspaceHardDeleted vs CronJobDeletedWorkspace, WebhookCreated vs JobWebhookCallCompleted)"
      - "Set shouldStoreInCache to true instead of false as in ground truth"
      - "Added unnecessary eventId and attributes parameters not present in ground truth implementation"
