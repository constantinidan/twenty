issue: Preserve all emails, phones, and links when merging records
overall_score: 4.2
passed: false
notes:
  strengths: |
    - The working directory has the core idea right: preserve additional primary values when merging
    - Implementation correctly handles deduplication using Set and uniqBy
    - Properly filters to exclude the priority record's primary from additional items
    - Uses the same utility functions and patterns as ground truth
  weaknesses: |
    - CRITICAL: Test coverage is incomplete - missing PHONES and LINKS test cases entirely
    - CRITICAL: Implementation uses a different logic pattern than ground truth
    - The approach of only collecting primary emails/phones/links from non-priority records differs from ground truth's approach of collecting from all records then filtering
    - Integration tests were not updated with new expected values
    - Missing 72 lines of new test cases that ground truth includes
  deviations:
    negative:
      - Implementation logic differs: uses conditional checks for non-priority records instead of collecting from all records then filtering
      - Test spec file missing PHONES and LINKS test cases (90 lines vs 162 lines in ground truth)
      - Integration test expectations not updated to reflect the changes
      - The working implementation excludes primary emails from the priority record itself in non-priority record check, which is logically different from ground truth's simpler approach
      - Variable naming differs (ground truth uses 'allEmails', 'allPhones', 'allLinks'; working uses 'allAdditionalEmails', 'allAdditionalPhones', 'allSecondaryLinks' with conditional primary collection)
